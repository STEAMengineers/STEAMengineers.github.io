My (Snoof's) birthday is long enough ago now that I don't have to worry about surprise candles, so I'll tell you what I've done about it!

It took some doing, but I bought myself a new sewing machine! I had to talk myself into it, even though I was struggling with my old one. It was running up against my desire to sew through seventeen layers of thick fabric for the purposes of making odd beasts.

What made it difficult wasn't a supply chain issue involving feed dogs, or a needle shortage. The difficult part was talking myself into it. Even though I know I'll use it often, and that having it will make some of my work significantly easier, I felt unjustified in spending that amount of money on something "nobody else would enjoy."

The thing is, obviously that's funny because I don't often make something that isn't a gift for someone else. My kids WILL enjoy a new sewing machine, as will my friends! Because I'll use it to make them things! But that's not the important bit. The important bit is that it's okay to spend money on something that's only going to bring joy to you. Especially when it's something that will make you happy and let you make things!

Now my old sewing machine has a new home to go to, fortunately. Her name is Sewdie Foster. And therein lies the rub.

As per the [DoES Liverpool](https://doesliverpool.com/) tradition, I like to name my equipment mostly punny names (my lasercutter, named Chopper for a Star Wars astromech, is the exception). We have ViNeil Diamond, Matthew Embroiderick, Sewdie Foster, and Heather Overlocklear. But what then can I name the new machine?

Chris and I spent a day giggling about various unacceptable options, but we got no closer to a solution. Lionel Stitchy? Leonard Sewhen? Liam Hemsworth?

Answers on a postcard please...
