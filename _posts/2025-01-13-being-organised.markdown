Being organised... It's one of those things, isn't it? Between the other work we do, hobbies, and various jobs aimed at keeping body and soul in roughly the same place, it can get really tricky. Luckily, 2025 is the year we're going to push hard for STEAM engineers to move forward!

What we'd really like, is if this time next year this blog contains lots of 2025 posts, and if we expanded our activities to include more regular events. We'll be working hard to make that happen, so please don't tune out!

On another note, [MakeFest 2025](https://liverpoolmakefest.org/) is on the 5th of July this year, and we'll definitely turn up - put it in your calendars now so you don't miss out. See you there?
