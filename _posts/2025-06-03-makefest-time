title:  "MakeFest Time!"
---
It's the most blunderful time of the year... The time of year when I swear I'll have everything sorted BEFORE the night before... and then spend the entire night before sobbing while preparing for Liverpool MakeFest. Will I ever learn? Place bets now. Very much bet on no!

MakeFest is this Saturday at Liverpool Central Library, and open to the public (for free) from 9 till 5. As you come in, we'll be to the right of the escalators - but definitely take the time to see everyone! It's going to be awesome :)

See you there?
