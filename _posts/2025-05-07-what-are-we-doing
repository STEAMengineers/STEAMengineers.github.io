title:  "What ARE We Doing???"
---
Well, it happened again. We're just so bad at keeping up with a blog - and Chris hasn't even **started** his post on PCB design yet (full on DARVOing the poor man while he works his very socks off on a daily basis, don't mind me).

What have we been doing, though? Well, the springtime is a very busy time for me in terms of running neurodiversity workshops on behalf of [the Brain Charity](https://www.thebraincharity.org.uk/), and Chris has been lucky enough to run some 3D printing workshops in secondary schools around Hull, where he was born and raised. Spring is a time when everyone suddenly realises they need to get doing before the summer comes and robs half their employees - and that means we've been busy! We've also been lucky enough to run some workshops at the library over the Easter holidays - we made some soft toy Easter bunnies I designed to be suitable even for quite young children, and we made some light-up Easter eggs. We'll be back in the library on the Friday of May half-term, so definitely come see us between 10 and 4!

In the meantime, other projects have by necessity taken a bit of a backseat. Partly because we're busy - Chris has some testing to do on the rechargeable Spoonbot boards and my lovely daughter is working on a case - and partly because I have ADHD - I spent 3 days looking for a partly assembled raccoon soft toy that turned out to be within farting distance from my seat in the living room.

Next up we have the funding question. The real dream is to have our own venue, with our own equipment, and our own weekly tech club again. But getting there isn't easy, and we're a little bit at sea when it comes to funding applications - especially when it comes to the undeniable fact we also have to pay ourselves wages. Not a good time to be a pair of awkward sods!

But we will get there, we're determined. Watch this space!
