Anyone who knows us, knows what happens when we learn something new. First we use it for everything for a little bit, and then we make it everybody else's problem.

Well, on this occasion, Chris learned how to design PCBs through working for [MQCN](https://mcqn.com/). In a twist of fate, around the time he got comfy, it became possible to do full-colour screenprints on the PCBs you were ordering. And therefore, inevitably... We put some robots on some circuit boards.

As I'm writing this, Chris is refreshing various tracking pages every 7 minutes as we wait for components and boards to arrive. And some of those boards might be available at the [free PCB soldering workshop](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/printed-circuit-board-pcb-soldering-workshop-free-tickets-1139713757529) taking place at [DoES Liverpool](https://doesliverpool.com/) this coming Wednesday.

Chris does some really mysterious stuff I need to get a better handle on - he draws little paths and figures out what needs to go where to make it all work. It's very exciting to see, and even more excitingly, I get to draw my silly little pictures and see them become part of the PCB!

(Image ID: the front of a screenprinted PCB showing a happy robot face on an 80s bus seat background. Each eye and the bobble at the end of the robot's antenna has a little rectangular hole in it. The board is held by a white hand. End ID.)

I really enjoy the process for these, because Chris works really hard to figure out ways to make my ideas work - it will get easier as I learn how to gauge what's possible. I had to restart BlinkieBot up there a couple of times, so working on saving my work appropriately (still), but I'll get there!

Anyway, delivery companies willing, they will be available for a nominal fee on Wednesday, if you have a ticket (or if you can still snag one). We're excited!
