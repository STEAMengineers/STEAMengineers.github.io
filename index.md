**STEAMengineers** is a company looking to introduce and educate people of all ages in STEAM! We believe that, with technology's exponential growth and change, it's impossible to know what skills will be needed going forward. But we can give people the confidence to approach new technologies, and learn new things without fear.

Chris Huffee and Snoof Kattekop have a long history of teaching children and adults about a vast range of STEAM-related topics - digital making, code, even crochet. Unfortunately, our previous venture didn't survive COVID - but we're back for a fresh start!
