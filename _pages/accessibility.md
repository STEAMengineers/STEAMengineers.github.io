### Who can join?

Simply put - anyone! We do have some age restrictions, which will be clearly posted on events, but other than that there is nothing stopping you from joining.

Please don’t feel like you can’t join us for any reason - if you’re worried, just give us a shout and we’ll put you at ease. If you or your child need us to do something different to make sure everyone is comfortable, then let us know and we’ll work with you to make sure we provide a welcoming environment.

We have, in the past, worked with very anxious children, as well as a vast array of neurodivergent and otherwise disabled people. Snoof is multiply disabled (among other things - autistic, ADHD, and a wheelchair user) and we approach accommodations not as a “special” need but as a normal need that needs to be addressed in a way that isn’t considered standard. For example - requiring a way to access the space isn’t a special need, just because someone needs it to be step-free. People who can walk normally get to access the space, so it’s a normal need that needs to be addressed a little differently for someone on wheels.

If you have questions about accessibility, or requests for specific accommodations, please contact Snoof. We can’t guarantee accommodations can always be made for obvious reasons, but we will make it a priority to work with you to ensure everything that can be done, is done.

We will provide accessibility information regarding specific venues on our booking pages.
