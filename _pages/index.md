### STEAM powered workshops

Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Maths - what more can we say?

We don't necessarily know what jobs in the future will look like, but we do know today's kids will need to know they can learn new technological skills, learn how to make new things, and know that they're talented and capable!

That's where we come in. Code, art, and digital making for all!

We provide engaging workshops for kids in the Liverpool City Region, teaching valuable skills and developing their unique approach to turning their ideas into reality.
