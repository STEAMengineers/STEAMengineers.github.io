### Resources ###

There's so much out there nowadays - and some of it's clickbait rather than actually helpful. If you're not very familiar with the subject matter, or if you don't have the time to research yourself, it can be hard to know where to start, so we thought we'd provide some links for people who want to get started or get their kids started alone.

##### Coding #####

Coding is one of our most popular topics, and there's luckily a tonne of stuff out there for people wanting to get stuck in!

**Blockcode** is a great way for kids to get started, teaching them the basics of how we communicate with computers in a simpler, more digestible way. It can really help adults too, building confidence and getting your feet firmly on the ladder and starting up. Don't be fooled by the people who look down on blockcode as not being "real" code; plenty of people find it useful for certain applications even if they have more complicated options at their fingertips.

A [micro:bit](https://makecode.microbit.org/) is a great place to start. It's a microcontroller, and you can buy it and use it to make many projects, some of which are outlined on the site, but the handy (free) editor has a little emulator to the left-hand side so you can get stuck in without the physical item, too. They're not very expensive, we recommend buying them from [Kitronik](https://kitronik.co.uk/), but they can be found elsewhere.

For very young children who are unable to read or write confidently yet, [ScratchJr](https://www.scratchjr.org/) is a great option. It comes in app form for Android and Apple tablets, completely free, and uses simple concepts just to teach the very basics of communicating with computers what you'd like them to do.

Slightly older kids can get their teeth into [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) where they can have a personal account to which to save their projects. These personal accounts are secure and don't allow for private contact between users. There are almost as many Scratch tutorials as there are stars in the sky, and kids will be surprised at what they can create. They can use their own digital art as backgrounds or sprites, too, so it can be perfect for kids who enjoy art.

[MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com/) is a little more complicated, but also allows for more complexity. Kids are, again, able to run a secure account on which they can save their projects, and there are plenty of tutorials available to follow, learn from, and base future games on.

[Godot](https://godotengine.org/) is more complex still, and a big step up from MakeCode Arcade, but again a lot of free resources are out there (check below) and the actual engine is free to download and use. Godot is in fairly popular use across all age groups from adult to older child, and once you're on board there's no stopping you. It can be trickier for people with dyslexia or visual processing issues, as it does require typing rather than dragging and dropping relevant components, but it's well worth looking into.
