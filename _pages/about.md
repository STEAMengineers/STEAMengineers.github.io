STEAM Engineers is above all a community where everyone is welcome. 

**Currently the team is made up of:**


### Snoof 

An artist and maker with too many skills to list here. She's got years of experience delivering community workshops for children and adults alike. You can see a sample of her work [here](https://robotorium.co.uk/gallery/).


### Chris

Chris Huffee has a degree in physics and is a qualified teacher.  Chris is a keen photographer and maker. His Instructables can be found [here](https://www.instructables.com/member/huffee/). Chris's work teaching digital making to children and adults inspired Snoof to start volunteering, and inevitably led to the partnership you see here.
