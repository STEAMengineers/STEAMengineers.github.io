STEAM Engineers is above all a community where everyone is welcome. 

**Currently the team is made up of:**


### Snoof 

An artist and maker with too many skills to list here. They've got years of experience delivering community workshops for children and adults alike. You can see a sample of their work [here](https://www.facebook.com/TheRobotorium).


### Chris

Chris Huffee has a degree in physics and is a qualified teacher.  Chris is a keen photographer and maker. His Instructables can be found [here](https://www.instructables.com/member/huffee/). Chris's work teaching digital making to children and adults inspired Snoof to start volunteering, and inevitably led to the partnership you see here.


**Why do we do this?**

### Little Sandbox

Before COVID-19 came on the scene, we were 2 of the 3 people running the Little Sandbox community makerspace in Norris Green Library. Unfortunately we had to roll up the business due to the pandemic, and we've been cobbling things together more or less ever since. We no longer have a venue, and most of our equipment is currently on extended loan to [DoES Liverpool](https://doesliverpool.com/), a larger community makerspace nearer the centre of town.

### New Beginnings

We missed Little Sandbox, especially the kids who used to come to tech club - so we started over again. We've been fitting STEAMengineers around the work we have to do to keep our bodies and souls in more or less the traditional configuration, but we're working hard towards full-time STEAMengineering.

For us, life is about making, coding, art, and making them as accessible as we can to as many people as we can. There are proven mental health benefits both to making things and to being part of a community; the skills in question are valuable for everyone but especially helpful as children find their way into a future where technology is advancing at an exponential rate; and as people grow more and more isolated in today's society there is nothing more valuable than building an inclusive community.

You'll find a link to free resources on the [Resources](resources.md) page, and we're working on an offering that teaches the skills and confidence kids need to succeed.
